<p>The white unicorn is a perfect combination of female and male energy.</p>
<ol>
<li> The white color connects this creature to the moon which has been a symbol of femininity throughout the ages.</li>
</ol>
 <ul> 
 <li>But, then again, its horn stands for strength and power and represents male energy.</li>
 <li>The white color stands for integrity and innocence.</li>
 </ul>
